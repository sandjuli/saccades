# count_unique

Recurrent glimpsing network models that count.

The code in this repository started off as simple idealizations of the visual
counting problem that gradually grew to include more complexity.

1. Counting the unique items in a sequence (one hot input vector sequences)
2. Determining numerosity from a symbolic form of the glimpsed image sequences
3. Simple images with tetris like shapes
4. Images containing digits
5. Images containing letters
